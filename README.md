Hello, I'm an aspiring Computer Science student.
I spent most of my time, coding. 
I'm obsessed with self-improvement books. 
I got a gold batch in Python and Java on HackerRank and I'm also interested in web technologies. 
One of my greatest work experiences is game development using Python at OurmateIT, Australia.
